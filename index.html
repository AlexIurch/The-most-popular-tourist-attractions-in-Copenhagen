                    Nyhavn Harbor</a></h2>

            <p class="par">To the rear of Amalienborg lies Nyhavn (New Harbor), which is flanked by a street of the same
                name. This enchanting area is a hub of activity, especially during summer. Brightly painted gabled
                buildings line the canal, adding a splash of color to dreary days and enticing visitors to stop in for a
                peek at the wares for sale in the shops and a tasty bite in the restaurants and caf√©s that call this
                place home.
            </p>
            <p class="par">At the end of the harbor, an anchor serves as a memorial to Danish sailors who lost their
                lives in World War II. Nyhavn was once a disreputable quarter of the city, but now, with its majestic
                feel, it is a particularly charming part of Copenhagen that features in countless images of the city.
            </p>
            <p class="par">Idyllic museum ships lie at anchor, including a lightship (Fyrskib) dating from 1885. From
                Nyhavn, hydrofoil and catamaran services operate to Sweden, as well as sightseeing trips around the
                harbor and along the canal.

            <p class="par">Kastellet is the former Citadel of Frederikshavn, the oldest parts of which date from 1625.
                The Citadel buildings are well maintained and well worth exploring. The Little Mermaid (Den lille
                Havfrue), which you'll see from the shore, is the official emblem of Copenhagen.
            </p>
            <p class="par">The bronze sculpture, created by Edvard Eriksen in 1913, is based on a theme from one of Hans
                Christian Andersen's fairy tales, which tells the tale of a mermaid who once came up out of the depths
                of the sea because she'd fallen in love with a prince. Sadly, as the prince didn't reciprocate, she was
                forced to leave the human world and return once more to the sea.
            </p>
            <p class="par">You won't be able to get right up to the mermaid herself, perched on rocks just offshore, but
                there are plenty of perfect spots to pose in front of this famous statue.

            <p class="par">On the tiny island of Slotsholmen is the Danish seat of government and an attraction that
                should top any
                visitor's agenda. Christiansborg boasts more than 800 years of history and today, the palace is home to
                the Parliament, the Prime Minister's Office, and the Supreme Court. </p>

            <p class="par"> In addition, several parts are still used by the Royal House, although thankfully, much is
                open to the
                public. Occupying the site where Bishop Absalon built the earliest fortifications of the city in 1167,
                the ruins of the bishop's castle and the medieval fortress were discovered when the present palace was
                under construction and can now be toured. </p>
            <p class="par">
                Among other points of interest are the Royal Kitchen, Royal Reception Rooms, Royal Stables, and the
                Palace Chapel. Opening hours for each section of the palace can vary since they are in use, so be sure
                to check ahead if you are interested in a specific area.
